# Run Larry Run

Academic project that was in development from September 2021 to December 2021.
Side-scolling infinite runner where you play as a lizard trying to escape captivity from the zoo. Avoid platforms and cars by jumping over them.
The longer you survive, the higher the score is!

I was the group leader for this project. My main tasks were to help determine the overall design of the game, from graphics to gameplay. I also programmed the management of the creation of certain game objects such as the enemies and obstacles you encounter in the game.

This game was developed in Visual Studio 2019 and used the MonoGame framework. Simply, download and run the exectuable application file in order to play it. If you wish to see the source code, please contact me.
